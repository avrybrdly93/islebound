# 33 — Current Task

**This file always reflects exactly one task in progress, or none.** It is the handoff point between work sessions. An agent starting work reads this file first, after `.github/AI_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`.

## If you are BLOCKED

Set `Status: BLOCKED`, fill in the section below, then **stop working on this task**. Pick a different unblocked task from the backlog and start a new entry — do not leave the project idle, and do not attempt to work around an architectural blocker unilaterally.

```markdown
### Blocked on
- **What:** the specific thing preventing progress
- **Why it can't be worked around:** …
- **Options considered:**
  1. … (cost, risk)
  2. … (cost, risk)
- **Recommendation:** …
- **Needs:** human decision | asset | dependency approval | architecture change approval
```

Blockers requiring human input include: any change to `04_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 or §5, any new runtime dependency, any change to a critical test (`29_TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §4), any change to `00_PROJECT_VISION.md`, and anything that would break save compatibility.
